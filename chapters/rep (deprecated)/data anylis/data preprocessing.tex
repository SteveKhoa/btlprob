\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
As we primarily only focus on analyzing \emph{some thing fill later}. We will only keep a couple of feature, that include: Vertical\_Segment, Status, Launch\_Date, Lithography, Recommended\_Customer\_Price, nb\_of\_Cores, nb\_of\_Threads, Processor\_Base\_Frequency, TDP, Max\_Memory\_Bandwidth, T.

As the data has a lot of unnecessary \_ in the code so we will rename it for more convenient coding.

Will insert it after we have agree on the feature.
