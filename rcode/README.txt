The dataset is NOT ready. Ask on group for further discussion.

Our dataset can NOT be cleaned throughly right from the beginning, the reasons are:
-   Too many NAs. But some of NA rows contain IMPORTANT features. We can not just 
    remove these rows.
-   Therefore, you MUST clean our data for your OWN purpose.
-   However, NK provided the code which clean stupid stuffs in prior (Global preprocessing). 
    These code which NK used, was stored in 'preprocesed.r'. Use it as reference.
    Ask the group for more.
