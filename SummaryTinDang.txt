First I try to use the column litho and the column bfreq in order to test the hypothesis that
whether the litho affect to the bfreq of CPU linearly or not. When I plot out, the line is likely
to go down since the litho small, the freq will be stronger.

Furthermore, the core should be accounted for the bfreq of the CPU, so I just use the regression of
two variables, including cores and compare with the first model by ANOVA and it can be seen that
adding the core does not improve much of the bfreq and still rely heavily on the litho.
